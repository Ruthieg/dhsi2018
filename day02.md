## Webpack

*"Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic."*  
*â€” Arthur C. Clarke*

Webpack is probably made by a wizard or group of wizards. There are some fairly big names in web development who have gone on record saying they don't understand, completely, how it works.

However, it is a really powerful and useful tool for building advanced web apps. The other nice thing about Webpack is once you have a configuration file that works, it will work for every project you write, so you only need to get it working once (or use the config script I am giving you).
